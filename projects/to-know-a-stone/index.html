      To Know A Stone is an experimental photographic project that attempts to sublimate the feeling of belonging to a particular place. The Friulian territory of Magredi is by its definition a desolate (magredo comes from the word magro which means thin, in this context desolate), difficult land, for which I have never felt any particular interest and to which I basically never felt I belonged. After spending almost eight years away from this arid territory, a feeling of nostalgia and affection began to surface making me docile toward that land I had always ignored. The symbol of this affection has fallen on the stone, more particularly on the pebbles (in Friulan clàps) found on the shore of the Cellina and Meduna streams that have always delimited what I consider home, both in a strictly geographical sense and in a more metaphorical and emotional sense. The intent of the project is therefore to sublimate this renewed sense of love and care by using the object that most represents this territory and consequently my relationship with it.

      The fragile transfer process used, a liquid emulsion applied directly to the stone, acts as a metaphor for the precariousness of identity and at the same time, the impression of self-portraits and images representing “me” within different stones and pebbles, represents the catharsis of a long process of accepting the self and one's roots.
